# Google Sign-in & Apple Sign-in

## Description:
This represents a sample of the Google Sign-in & Apple Sign-in.

  - For iOS devices, the following sign-in methods are available:
    - Sign-in with Google
    - Sign-in with Apple

  - For Android devices, the following sign-in methods are available:
    - Sign-in with Google

Please note that Android devices do not offer support for the "Sign-in with Apple" feature due to concerns related to integrity and security.

The "Sign-in with Apple" feature is not compatible with iOS simulators; it requires a physical iOS device for functionality. Since I didn't have access to such a device, I wasn't able to test this code on the iOS platform.

Upon successful sign-in, the app will transition to a new screen where users can access their personal information, including their profile picture, full name, email address, and a unique account ID.
